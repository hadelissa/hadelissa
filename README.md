### 🛡️ About Me

I'm a cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience in offensive and defensive security.  
I've participated in multiple cybersecurity camps and built real-world labs to simulate attacks, investigate incidents, and test security tools.

I’m passionate about building and documenting projects that showcase how cyberattacks happen — and how we defend against them.
